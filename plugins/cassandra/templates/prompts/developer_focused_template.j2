You are an expert Cassandra data modeling analyst creating a report for an application development team.

**Analysis Context:**
- Cassandra Version: {{ db_version }}
- Target Keyspace: {{ database_name }}

**Goal of this Report:**
Identify data modeling issues and schema anti-patterns that can be addressed at the application level. Focus on table design, compaction strategies, tombstone accumulation, and query patterns. Provide specific, actionable CQL and application-level recommendations.

Your output MUST follow these formatting requirements:
- Create a `=== Schema and Data Modeling Analysis` section. Identify tables using SimpleStrategy, tables with inappropriate compaction strategies, and potential wide partition issues.
- Create a `=== Query Pattern Recommendations` section. Discuss tombstone accumulation from excessive deletes, implications of secondary indexes, and materialized view health.
- Create a `=== Application Best Practices` section. Cover batch operation guidelines, proper use of TTL, and consistency level recommendations.
- For each finding, provide example CQL statements to investigate and remediate the issue.
- Use `[source,cql]` blocks extensively for queries and `[source,yaml]` for table definitions.

**Pre-Analysis Summary of Key Findings**
Based on an initial programmatic analysis, the following issues have been flagged as potentially relevant to developers. Please create a detailed, actionable report based on them.

{% if critical_issues %}
**Critical Issues Detected:**
{% for issue in critical_issues -%}
- Metric: {{ issue.metric }} - Reason: {{ issue.analysis.reasoning }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if high_priority_issues %}
**High-Priority Issues Detected:**
{% for issue in high_priority_issues -%}
- Metric: {{ issue.metric }} - Reason: {{ issue.analysis.reasoning }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if medium_priority_issues %}
**Medium-Priority Issues Detected:**
{% for issue in medium_priority_issues -%}
- Metric: {{ issue.metric }} - Reason: {{ issue.analysis.reasoning }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
