        "reasoning": "One or more keyspaces show high disk usage concentration (max: {data.get('max_percent', 0):.1f}%). High concentration in a single keyspace indicates potential data skew, uneven partitioning, or application-specific growth patterns that could lead to hotspotting, reduced performance, and capacity planning issues.",

          "Analyze partition key distribution for the highest-usage keyspaces to identify hotspots.",
          "Consider data archiving or partitioning strategies to balance load across keyspaces.",
          "Monitor ongoing growth with regular tablestats runs and set alerts for >70% usage.",
          "Plan cluster expansion: Add nodes or increase replication if storage pressure continues."
