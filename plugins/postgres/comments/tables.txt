=== Table Management Best Practices

Effective table management is fundamental to PostgreSQL performance, storage efficiency, and data integrity.

.  **Monitor Table Sizes**: Regularly track the size of your tables (including TOAST tables) to understand data growth patterns and identify unexpectedly large tables.
.  **Manage Bloat**: High `n_dead_tup` (dead tuples) indicates table bloat. Ensure autovacuum is effectively configured to reclaim space. Consider `VACUUM FULL` or `pg_repack` for severe bloat, but be aware of their locking behavior.
.  **Partition Large Tables**: For very large tables (e.g., multi-terabyte tables or tables with high insert/delete rates), consider implementing declarative partitioning. Partitioning can improve query performance by allowing "pruning" (scanning only relevant partitions) and simplify data archiving/purging.
.  **Review Table Design**: Ensure tables are normalized appropriately. Denormalization can sometimes be beneficial for read performance, but it increases write complexity and potential for data inconsistency.
.  **Choose Appropriate Data Types**: Use the most efficient data types for your columns (e.g., `INT` instead of `BIGINT` if values fit, `TEXT` only when necessary, `VARCHAR(N)` for fixed-length strings).
.  **Primary Keys**: Always define primary keys for your tables. They enforce uniqueness and provide a clustered index.
.  **Foreign Keys**: Use foreign keys to enforce referential integrity between tables. As discussed in the Foreign Key Audit, ensure they are properly indexed.
.  **TOAST Tables**: Be aware of TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique) tables for columns storing large values (e.g., `TEXT`, `BYTEA`). Monitor their size and bloat.
.  **Table Statistics**: Ensure `ANALYZE` runs regularly to keep table statistics up-to-date for the query planner. For tables with highly skewed data distribution or very high insert rates, consider setting `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS ...` for specific columns.
