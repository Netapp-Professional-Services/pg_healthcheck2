A Prioritized Approach to Refactoring

Not all modules are created equal. I recommend tackling them in logical groups, starting with the most foundational checks. This ensures that the core of the health check tool is robustly using the new pattern first.

Phase 1: Core Configuration & Performance Settings
These are the most critical modules to update first as they often provide the context for other checks.

    critical_performance_settings.py

    general_config_settings.py

    section_postgresql_settings.py

    data_checksums_analysis.py

    lock_wait_config.py

Phase 2: High-Impact Performance Metrics
These modules analyze core performance areas and are the heart of the health check.

    bgwriter.py

    checkpoint.py

    wal_usage.py

    vacstat2.py

    section_cache_analysis.py

Phase 3: Auditing and Security
These modules are important for security and compliance.

    foreign_key_audit.py

    function_audit.py

    hba_rules_audit.py

    primary_key_analysis.py

    users.py / users2.py

Phase 4: Remaining Modules & Tooling
This final phase covers the remaining checks and internal tooling.

    Includes all other modules like aurora_cpu_metrics.py, connection_pooling.py, datadog_setup.py, etc.

Refactoring Example: checkpoint.py

Let's walk through a complete refactoring of a module from your list. The checkpoint.py module likely analyzes data from the pg_stat_bgwriter view, whose columns changed in PostgreSQL 15.

Step 1: Create the Query Builder in postgresql_version_compatibility.py

First, we add a new function to our central compatibility module. This function will be responsible for providing the correct query based on the version information stored in the connector.

File: plugins/postgres/utils/postgresql_version_compatibility.py
Python

# ... (add this new function to the file)

def get_checkpoint_query(connector):
    """
    Returns the appropriate query for checkpoint analysis based on PG version.
    The 'pg_stat_bgwriter' view was expanded in PostgreSQL 15.
    """
    if connector.version_info.get('is_pg15_or_newer'):
        # PostgreSQL 15 and newer query
        return """
            SELECT
                checkpoints_timed,
                checkpoints_req,
                checkpoint_write_time,
                checkpoint_sync_time,
                checkpoint_proc_time,
                (checkpoints_timed + checkpoints_req) as total_checkpoints
            FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;
        """
    else:
        # Query for versions older than 15
        return """
            SELECT
                checkpoints_timed,
                checkpoints_req,
                checkpoint_write_time,
                checkpoint_sync_time,
                (checkpoints_timed + checkpoints_req) as total_checkpoints
            FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;
        """

Step 2: Refactor the checkpoint.py Module

Now, we update the check module itself. We remove all local version detection and instead use our new, centralized function.

File: plugins/postgres/checks/checkpoint.py

üëé Before (Old Pattern):
Python

# from plugins.postgres.utils.misc import get_postgresql_version # REMOVE THIS

def run_checkpoint_analysis(connector, settings):
    # version = get_postgresql_version(connector) # REMOVE THIS
    #
    # if version['major_version'] >= 15: # REMOVE THIS LOGIC
    #     query = "SELECT ... -- PG15+ query"
    # else:
    #     query = "SELECT ... -- Pre-PG15 query"
    #
    # ...

üëç After (New, Correct Pattern):
Python

# Import the new function from the central compatibility module
from plugins.postgres.utils.postgresql_version_compatibility import get_checkpoint_query

def run_checkpoint_analysis(connector, settings):
    """
    Analyzes checkpoint performance metrics from pg_stat_bgwriter.
    """
    adoc_content = ["=== Checkpoint Analysis"]
    
    try:
        # Get the version-aware query from our centralized helper
        checkpoint_query = get_checkpoint_query(connector)
        
        # Execute the query
        formatted, raw = connector.execute_query(checkpoint_query, return_raw=True)
        
        if "[ERROR]" in formatted:
            adoc_content.append(formatted)
        elif not raw:
            adoc_content.append("[NOTE]\n====\nCould not retrieve checkpoint statistics.\n====\n")
        else:
            # The module now focuses on *analyzing* the data, not fetching it
            adoc_content.append("[IMPORTANT]\n====\nFrequent checkpoints can indicate an undersized `max_wal_size`. Checkpoints should primarily be time-based (`checkpoints_timed`), not requested (`checkpoints_req`).\n====\n")
            adoc_content.append(formatted)
            
    except Exception as e:
        adoc_content.append(f"[ERROR]\n====\nCould not analyze checkpoints: {e}\n====\n")

    return "\n".join(adoc_content), {"checkpoint_stats": raw}

This refactored module is now cleaner, adheres to the new architecture, and is much easier to maintain. By applying this same two-step process to the other modules in your list, your development team can systematically and efficiently complete this important refactoring effort.
