====

=== Datadog Monitoring Setup
Analyzes PostgreSQL configuration relevant to Datadog monitoring.

Shared Preload Libraries (for pg_stat_statements)
|===
|name|setting|short_desc
|shared_preload_libraries|pg_stat_statements|Lists shared libraries to preload into server.
|===
Key Logging Settings
|===
|name|setting|short_desc
|log_connections|off|Logs each successful connection.
|log_disconnections|off|Logs end of a session, including duration.
|log_min_duration_statement|-1|Sets the minimum execution time above which all statements will be logged.
|log_statement|none|Sets the type of statements logged.
|===
[TIP]
====
Datadog relies on specific PostgreSQL configurations (like `pg_stat_statements` and detailed logging) to provide comprehensive monitoring. Ensure `shared_preload_libraries` includes `pg_stat_statements` for query-level metrics. Configure `log_min_duration_statement` to capture slow queries and enable `log_connections`/`log_disconnections` for connection auditing. For self-hosted instances, verify the Datadog Agent is running and configured correctly.
====


== Cache Analysis

=== Cache Analysis
Analyzes PostgreSQL buffer cache usage and hit ratios to identify performance bottlenecks.

Database Cache Hit Ratio
|===
|datname|blks_hit|blks_read|hit_ratio_percent

|public|orders_indexed_fk|on|on|50|0.2|50|0.1
|===
[TIP]
====
Autovacuum is critical for maintaining database health and performance by reclaiming dead tuples and preventing transaction ID wraparound. Ensure `autovacuum` is `on` globally. Review `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` and `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` for appropriate thresholds. High `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` can slow down vacuuming; consider reducing it for busy systems. Identify tables with disabled autovacuum or custom settings that might be causing bloat or performance issues. For Aurora, autovacuum parameters are managed via the DB cluster parameter group.

====

[TIP]
====
Proper configuration of `pg_stat_statements` is vital for capturing comprehensive query metrics. Adjust `pg_stat_statements.max` to ensure enough statements are tracked, and `pg_stat_statements.track` to `all` for full visibility. Regularly reset statistics (`pg_stat_statements_reset()`) for focused analysis periods.

[TIP]
====
Regularly monitoring these general metrics provides a high-level view of database activity. High `xact_rollback` counts can indicate application errors or contention. Compare `blks_read` vs `blks_hit` to understand cache efficiency. For Aurora, these metrics complement CloudWatch data and help pinpoint database-internal performance characteristics.
====


=== Monitoring Recommendations
Provides best practices and recommendations for comprehensive PostgreSQL monitoring.
[TIP]
====
Implement a robust monitoring solution (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus/Grafana, CloudWatch) to track key PostgreSQL metrics. Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O (IOPS, throughput), network, active connections, transaction rates, and replication lag. Set up alerts for critical thresholds to ensure proactive issue detection. Regularly review slow query logs and `pg_stat_statements` for query optimization opportunities.
====

|===
[TIP]
====
High Availability is crucial for minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity. For self-hosted setups, ensure proper configuration of streaming replication, `wal_level`, `max_wal_senders`, and `hot_standby`. Regularly test failover procedures to verify HA readiness. Consider external tools like Patroni or repmgr for automated failover and cluster management.
====


== WAL and Checkpoints

=== Checkpoint Activity
Analyzes checkpoint activity to optimize WAL performance and reduce I/O load.

Checkpoint Statistics (PostgreSQL 17+)
|===
|checkpoints_timed|checkpoints_req|checkpoint_write_time|checkpoint_sync_time|buffers_checkpoint
|111|1|105804.0|33.0|54127
|===

|===
|name|setting|unit|short_desc
|checkpoint_completion_target|0.9|None|Time spent flushing dirty buffers during checkpoint, as fraction of checkpoint interval.
|checkpoint_timeout|300|s|Sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints.
|max_wal_size|4096|MB|Sets the WAL size that triggers a checkpoint.
|===
[TIP]
====
High checkpoint frequency can increase I/O load. Adjust `checkpoint_timeout` or `max_wal_size` to reduce checkpoint frequency. For Aurora, tune these settings via the RDS parameter group to mitigate CPU and IOPS saturation.
====

[NOTE]
====
In PostgreSQL 17 and newer, checkpoint statistics like timed and requested checkpoints, write time, sync time, and buffers written are available in `pg_stat_checkpointer`.
====


=== WAL Usage and Archiving
Analyzes Write-Ahead Log (WAL) usage and archiving status to optimize performance and ensure reliable recovery.

WAL Archiving Status
|===
|archived_count|failed_count|last_archived_wal|last_archived_time|last_failed_wal|last_failed_time
|0|0|None|None|None|None
|===
WAL Configuration Settings
|===
|name|setting|unit|short_desc
|archive_mode|off|None|Allows archiving of WAL files using "archive_command".
|archive_timeout|0|s|Sets the amount of time to wait before forcing a switch to the next WAL file.
|max_wal_size|4096|MB|Sets the WAL size that triggers a checkpoint.
|wal_level|replica|None|Sets the level of information written to the WAL.
|===
[TIP]
====
Ensure archive_mode is 'on' and monitor failed_count for archiving issues. Adjust archive_timeout to balance WAL segment creation and I/O load. For Aurora, verify WAL archiving setup via the RDS parameter group and CloudWatch metrics (e.g., WriteIOPS) to address CPU saturation.
====


=== Background Writer Statistics
Analyzes background writer activity to optimize buffer management and reduce I/O load.

Background Writer Metrics (PostgreSQL 17+)
|===
|buffers_clean|maxwritten_clean|buffers_alloc
|0|0|55488
|===
Background Writer Configuration
|===
|name|setting|unit|short_desc
|bgwriter_delay|200|ms|Background writer sleep time between rounds.
|bgwriter_lru_maxpages|100|None|Background writer maximum number of LRU pages to flush per round.
|bgwriter_lru_multiplier|2|None|Multiple of the average buffer usage to free per round.
|===
[TIP]
====
High `buffers_alloc` values indicate significant buffer allocation activity. Adjust `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` or reduce `bgwriter_delay` for more aggressive cleaning to optimize buffer management. For Aurora, tune these settings via the RDS parameter group to mitigate CPU and IOPS saturation.
====


== Index Analysis

=== Index Usage in Read Replica Environments
Provides guidance for analyzing index usage across primary and replica nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====

**🔍 INDEX USAGE ANALYSIS IN READ REPLICA ENVIRONMENTS**


Index usage statistics (`pg_stat_user_indexes`) are tracked per-instance. 
This means an index that appears 'unused' on the primary/master node 
may actually be heavily used on read replicas.


====

=== Why This Happens


**Query Distribution Patterns:**

- **Primary/Master**: Handles writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

- **Read Replicas**: Handle SELECT queries and read operations

- **Application Routing**: Queries are often routed based on operation type


**Index Usage Statistics:**

- `idx_scan`: Number of scans on this index (per-instance)

- `idx_tup_read`: Number of index entries returned by scans

- `idx_tup_fetch`: Number of live table rows fetched by simple index scans


=== Recommended Analysis Approach


**Step 1: Check Index Usage on Primary**

```sql

SELECT schemaname||'.'||relname AS table_name, indexrelname AS index_name, 
       idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_scan = 0 
ORDER BY schemaname, relname, indexrelname;

```


**Step 2: Check Index Usage on ALL Read Replicas**

Run the same query on each read replica to get complete picture.


**Step 3: Aggregate Usage Statistics**

Combine results from all nodes to identify truly unused indexes.


**Step 4: Analyze Query Patterns**

```sql

-- Find queries that might use specific indexes

SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%table_name%' 
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC;

```


=== Before Removing Any Index


**✅ Pre-Removal Checklist:**

1. **Verify usage on ALL nodes** (primary + all replicas)

2. **Check for unique constraints** (indexes supporting UNIQUE constraints)

3. **Review foreign key constraints** (indexes supporting FK relationships)

4. **Analyze application query patterns** (which queries go to which nodes)

5. **Test in staging environment** (never remove production indexes without testing)

6. **Monitor performance impact** (both before and after removal)


=== Aurora-Specific Considerations


**AWS RDS Aurora Environment:**

- Aurora read replicas may have different index usage patterns than the writer

- Check index usage on ALL Aurora read replicas before removal

- Monitor `ReadIOPS` and `WriteIOPS` after index changes

- Use Performance Insights to analyze query patterns across nodes

- Consider the impact on Aurora's storage optimization


=== Safe Index Removal Process


**🛡️ Recommended Process:**

1. **Identify candidate indexes** (unused on all nodes)

2. **Verify no constraints** (unique, foreign key, etc.)

3. **Test in staging** (create same indexes, test removal)

4. **Monitor performance** (before/after metrics)

5. **Remove during low-traffic period** (maintenance window)

6. **Monitor post-removal** (performance, errors, etc.)


=== Monitoring Queries


**Useful queries for index analysis:**

```sql

-- Check for unique constraints

SELECT conname, conrelid::regclass, contype 
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE contype = 'u' AND conrelid::regclass::text LIKE '%your_table%';


-- Check for foreign key constraints

SELECT conname, conrelid::regclass, confrelid::regclass 
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE contype = 'f' AND conrelid::regclass::text LIKE '%your_table%';


-- Check index sizes

SELECT schemaname||'.'||relname AS table_name, indexrelname AS index_name, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS index_size 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_scan = 0 
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;

```


[TIP]
====

**Best Practice:** Always maintain a comprehensive view of index usage across your entire database cluster. 
What appears unused on one node may be critical on another. 
When in doubt, keep the index - the storage cost is usually worth the performance benefit.

====


=== Unused Indexes
Identifies unused indexes in the PostgreSQL database.
|===
|schemarelname|indexrelname
|public.documents_gin|idx_documents_gin_title_trgm
|public.documents_gin|documents_gin_pkey
|public.documents_gin|idx_documents_gin_content
|public.event_stream|event_stream_pkey
|public.logs_brin|logs_brin_pkey
|===
Unused indexes were found. Since indexes can add significant overhead to any table change operation, they should be removed if they are not being used for either queries or constraint enforcement (such as making sure a value is unique).

**⚠️ CRITICAL CONSIDERATION FOR READ REPLICAS ⚠️**


Indexes that appear 'unused' on the primary/master node may actually be heavily used on read replicas!


**Why this happens:**

- Read replicas handle SELECT queries while the primary handles writes

- Index usage statistics (`idx_scan`) are tracked per-instance

- An index unused on primary might be critical for replica performance


**Before removing any 'unused' indexes:**

1. **Check all read replicas** for index usage statistics

2. **Analyze query patterns** - replicas often handle different query types

3. **Review application routing** - ensure you understand which queries go where

4. **Test thoroughly** in staging environment before production removal


**Recommended approach:**

- Use `pg_stat_user_indexes` on ALL nodes (primary + replicas)

- Aggregate usage statistics across the entire cluster

- Only remove indexes that are truly unused across all nodes

====

[TIP]
====
Regularly review `pg_stat_user_indexes` for indexes with `idx_scan = 0`. These indexes consume disk space and add overhead to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations without providing query performance benefits. Consider dropping unused indexes after thorough analysis and testing.
====

[NOTE]
====
For standard PostgreSQL with read replicas:
- Check index usage on all replica nodes
- Consider using `pg_stat_statements` to identify which queries use which indexes
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to verify index usage in query plans

Identifies duplicate indexes in the PostgreSQL database.

|===
|size|idx1|idx2
|1632 kB|users_dup_idx_username_key|idx_users_dup_username
|1360 kB|idx_users_dup_email|idx_users_dup_email_redundant
|===
[CAUTION]
====
Duplicate indexes were found.
Duplicate or multiple indexes that have the same set of columns, same opclass, expression and predicate make them equivalent.

. Review source code to determine where they may have originated from.
. Understand why a duplicate might exist.
. It may have had some purpose at some point.
. Test thoroughly before taking any action.
. Do not automate the task of dropping one of them.
====

[TIP]
====
Duplicate indexes consume unnecessary disk space and add overhead to write operations. They do not provide additional performance benefits for queries. Identify and remove redundant indexes to improve write performance and reduce storage costs.
====


=== Tables with Potentially Missing Indexes
Identifies tables with high sequential scans and low or no index scans, indicating potential missing indexes.
|===
|schemarelname|rows_read|rows_estimated|seq_scans
|public.event_stream|0|0|0
|public.pgbench_tellers|0|0|0
|public.daily_sales_summary|0|0|0
|public.sensor_data_2024_q1|0|0|0
|public.sales_data|0|0|0
|===
[IMPORTANT]
====
We might have some missing indexes...

. The name of the table (schemarelname) including the schemaname.
. How often our table has been read sequentially (seq_scan).
. How often an index has been used is NOT shown... since it's 0 or null.
. The most important information is rows_read. It tells us how many rows the system had to process to satisfy all those sequential scans.
====

[TIP]
====
Tables with high `seq_scan` counts and low `idx_scan` counts are strong candidates for new indexes. Focus on tables where `rows_read` is high, as this indicates significant data scanning. Proper indexing can drastically reduce I/O and CPU usage for read-heavy queries.
====


=== Largest Indexes
Identifies the largest indexes in the PostgreSQL database.
|===
|table_name|Total Size|Index Size|Actual Size
|pgbench_accounts|1498 MB|214 MB|1283 MB
|logs_brin|501 MB|113 MB|388 MB
|event_stream|25 MB|4408 kB|21 MB
|users_dup_idx|4016 kB|3232 kB|752 kB
|sales_data|8128 kB|2208 kB|5888 kB
|===
[TIP]
====
Large indexes consume significant disk space and can impact the performance of `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations. They also increase backup and restore times. Review the necessity of very large indexes; consider partial indexes or re-evaluating indexing strategies if they are excessively large relative to the table size.
====


=== BRIN Index Analysis
Analyzes BRIN (Block Range Index) indexes to evaluate their usage and efficiency.
BRIN Index Details

|===
[TIP]
====
BRIN indexes are efficient for large, monotonically increasing data (e.g., timestamps). Ensure they are used for appropriate workloads. Low idx_scan values may indicate underutilized indexes; consider replacing with B-tree indexes if range queries are frequent. For Aurora, monitor index performance via CloudWatch metrics.
====

=== GIN Index Analysis
Analyzes GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) indexes to evaluate their usage and efficiency.

GIN Index Details
|===
|table_name|index_name|index_type|index_size

|public.documents_gin|idx_documents_gin_content|0|0|0
|public.documents_gin|idx_documents_gin_title_trgm|0|0|0
|===
[TIP]
====
GIN indexes are best suited for columns that contain composite values, such as arrays or full-text search documents. Monitor `idx_scan` to ensure GIN indexes are being utilized for relevant queries. GIN indexes can be larger and slower to build/update than B-tree indexes, so ensure their benefits outweigh their overhead for your workload.

== Table Analysis

=== Large Tables Analysis
Identifies large tables by size to assess storage and performance impact.
Large Tables
|===
|table_name|total_size|table_size|index_size|estimated_rows

|public.users_dup_idx|4016 kB|784 kB|3232 kB|10000.0
|===
[TIP]
====
Large tables with high index sizes may contribute to I/O and CPU load. Consider partitioning large tables or optimizing indexes. For Aurora, monitor IOPS and storage usage via CloudWatch to manage performance.
====

=== Database Object Counts
Provides a summary count of various database object types.
Summary of Database Objects
|===
|Object Type|Count
|Tables|18
|Views|2
|Materialized Views|1
|Indexes|20
|Sequences|9
|Functions/Procedures|39
|Schemas|1
|Foreign Keys|2
|Partitions|6
|===
[TIP]
====
Monitoring object counts provides a high-level view of database complexity and growth. A sudden increase in certain object types (e.g., tables, functions) might indicate application changes or unexpected behavior. High numbers of indexes or foreign keys should prompt a review of their necessity and proper indexing to avoid performance overheads.
====


=== Materialized View Analysis
Analyzes materialized views for size, refresh status, and potential optimization opportunities.
Materialized View Sizes and Population Status

|===
Materialized View XID Age and Last Refresh
[NOTE]
====
Query not applicable.
====

[TIP]
====
Monitor materialized view sizes and ensure they are regularly refreshed to reflect current data. High XID age on materialized views can indicate a need for more frequent refreshes or `VACUUM FREEZE` if not refreshed concurrently. Consider `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY` for large views to minimize downtime. For Aurora, materialized views behave similarly, and their refresh strategy should be optimized for performance and data freshness.
====


=== Partitioned Tables Analysis
Identifies and analyzes partitioned tables and their individual partitions.
List Partitioned Tables (Parents)

|sensor_data_2024_q1|152 kB
|sensor_data_2023_q2|152 kB
|===
[TIP]
====
Partitioned tables are essential for managing large datasets, improving query performance, and simplifying data retention. Ensure your partitioning strategy aligns with your data access patterns. Monitor individual partition sizes to identify skew or unexpected growth. For Aurora, partitioning can significantly aid in managing large tables and improving query performance.
====


=== Tables with High Insert Activity
Identifies tables experiencing a high volume of new row insertions.
Tables with High Insert Activity (n_tup_ins > 500000)
[NOTE]
====
No tables found with high insert activity.
====

[TIP]
====
Tables with consistently high insert rates can be a source of increased CPU usage, IOPS, and table bloat. Ensure that `autovacuum` is aggressively configured for such tables to prevent excessive dead tuple accumulation. Consider optimizing application-side insert patterns, such as batching inserts or using `COPY` for bulk data loading, to reduce transaction overhead. For Aurora, high insert activity directly impacts `WriteIOPS` and `CPUUtilization` metrics in CloudWatch.
====


=== Top Write-Intensive Queries
Identifies queries that generate significant write activity.
[NOTE]
====
This section lists the top queries that generate significant write activity (based on rows affected, WAL bytes, or blocks written). Due to query normalization in `pg_stat_statements`, these queries may not directly show the table names if they are parameterized. Manual inspection of the query text is recommended for correlation.
====

|===
[TIP]
====
Optimizing write-intensive queries is crucial for overall database performance. Look for opportunities to batch operations, use `COPY` for bulk loads, or improve indexing strategies on heavily written tables. Analyze query plans (`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`) to understand resource consumption. For Aurora, excessive write activity directly impacts `WriteIOPS` and `CPUUtilization` metrics in CloudWatch.
====


=== Table Metrics
Analyzes table sizes and live/dead tuples to identify potential issues.

High dead tuples may indicate autovacuum tuning needs. Run VACUUM ANALYZE on large tables.
====

=== Foreign Key Audit
Audits foreign key constraints to identify potential write-amplification issues and ensure data integrity.
All Foreign Keys Defined
|===
|foreign_key_name|child_table|constraint_definition
|fk_product_indexed|orders_indexed_fk|FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES parent_products(product_id)
|fk_product_unindexed|orders_unindexed_fk|FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES parent_products(product_id)
|===
Foreign Keys Missing Indexes on Child Table
|===
|foreign_key_name|child_table|fk_col_names|parent_table|pk_col_names
|fk_product_unindexed|public.orders_unindexed_fk|['product_id']|public.parent_products|['product_id']
|===
[TIP]
====
Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity, but unindexed foreign key columns on the child table can lead to significant write amplification. When a row in the parent table is `DELETE`d or `UPDATE`d, PostgreSQL must scan the child table to ensure no referencing rows exist. Without an index on the foreign key column(s) in the child table, this becomes a full table scan, consuming excessive I/O and CPU. Ensure indexes exist on all foreign key columns in child tables, especially for parent tables that experience frequent `DELETE`s or `UPDATE`s.
====


=== Recommended SQL for Missing Foreign Key Indexes
[IMPORTANT]
====
The following `CREATE INDEX` statements are recommended to improve write performance on parent tables with frequently updated/deleted rows, by adding indexes to the corresponding foreign key columns in child tables. Always test these changes in a staging environment before applying to production.
====

[,sql]
----
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_unindexed_fk_product_id_fk ON public.orders_unindexed_fk (product_id);
----

=== Tables Without Primary or Unique Keys
Identifies tables lacking Primary Keys or Unique Keys, which can impact replication and data integrity.

Tables Without Primary or Unique Keys
|===
|schema_name|table_name
|public|pgbench_history
|public|sensor_data_2022_q4
|public|sensor_data_2023_q1
|public|sensor_data_2023_q2
|public|sensor_data_2023_q3
|===
[TIP]
====
Tables without a Primary Key (PK) or a Unique Key (UK) can pose significant challenges, especially for logical replication. Logical replication requires a unique identifier to correctly apply `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations on the subscriber. Without a PK/UK, replication might fall back to less efficient methods (e.g., full table scans based on all columns) or even fail. Additionally, PKs/UKs are fundamental for data integrity and efficient query planning.
====


== Function and Stored Procedure Audit

=== Function Audit
Audits database functions for security risks and performance insights.
[IMPORTANT]
====
Potential security vulnerabilities identified in functions:

* One or more `SECURITY DEFINER` functions were found. These require careful review to prevent privilege escalation.

* One or more functions are owned by superusers. Consider reassigning ownership to less privileged roles where appropriate.

====

=== Top Statements by Execution Time (pg_stat_statements, PostgreSQL 14+)
[NOTE]
====
For PostgreSQL 14 and newer, `pg_stat_statements` tracks statistics per `queryid` (hashed statement). Direct linking to function OIDs (`funcid`) is not available in this view. The following table shows top statements by execution time, which may include function calls. Manual inspection of the `query` column is required to identify specific function calls.

|===
[TIP]
====
Functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` can pose a security risk if not carefully managed, as they execute with the privileges of their creator, not the caller. Review these functions to ensure their functionality is strictly necessary and their execution is limited to trusted users. Functions owned by superusers should also be scrutinized; consider reassigning ownership to less privileged roles where possible. Monitoring function execution time and call counts (via `pg_stat_statements`) is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks within your application's database logic.
====

[NOTE]
====
Functions employing dynamic SQL (e.g., using `EXECUTE` statements) should be manually audited for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Ensure all external inputs used in dynamic queries are properly sanitized using `FORMAT()` or `quote_ident()`/`quote_literal()` to prevent malicious code execution.

|===
[TIP]
====
Queries with high `total_exec_time` or `mean_exec_time` are consuming significant database resources. Investigate these queries for optimization opportunities, such as adding appropriate indexes, rewriting inefficient parts, or adjusting application logic. For Aurora, optimizing these queries directly reduces `CPUUtilization` and improves overall performance.
====


=== Active Query States
Analyzes the states of active queries to identify contention or idle sessions.

Active Query States
|===
|state|query_count
|active|1
|===
[TIP]
====
Monitoring active query states helps in understanding current database workload and identifying issues. High counts of 'idle in transaction' indicate uncommitted transactions, which can hold locks and prevent vacuuming. 'waiting' states point to lock contention. Regularly review `pg_stat_activity` to pinpoint problematic sessions and queries.
====


=== Long-Running Queries
Identifies long-running queries that may contribute to performance issues.

Long-Running Queries
[NOTE]
====
No results returned.
====

[TIP]
====
Long-running queries (duration > 1 minute) may cause CPU or I/O bottlenecks. Investigate and optimize these queries, or terminate them if necessary (e.g., using pg_terminate_backend(pid)). For Aurora, monitor long-running queries via CloudWatch and consider query optimization or scaling.
====

=== Lock Wait Configuration
Analyzes the 'log_lock_waits' setting for deadlock detection.

Lock Wait Configuration
|===
|name|setting|unit|short_desc
|log_lock_waits|off|None|Logs long lock waits.
|===
[TIP]
====
The `log_lock_waits` parameter (when set to `on`) is essential for PostgreSQL to log information about sessions waiting for locks. This helps in identifying queries that are frequently involved in lock contention or deadlocks. If you are experiencing performance issues related to concurrency, ensure this setting is enabled to aid in diagnosis.
====


=== Current Lock Waits
Identifies current sessions waiting for locks.

Current Lock Waits
[NOTE]
====
No results returned.
====

[TIP]
====
Sessions in a 'waiting' state for a lock indicate active contention. Investigate the `query` of the waiting session and the session holding the lock (which will have `pl.granted = true` for the same lock). Optimize conflicting queries with better indexing, reduce transaction isolation levels if appropriate, or implement proper transaction management. Persistent lock waits can degrade performance and lead to deadlocks.
====


=== Hot Queries
Identifies frequently executed queries to pinpoint potential performance bottlenecks due to high volume.

By querying `pg_stat_statements`, this section identifies queries that are executed most frequently (`calls`). Even if a query is individually fast, a very high call count can lead to significant cumulative resource consumption (CPU, I/O) and impact overall database performance. These queries could potentially impact performance and are likely to also show up in the 'Missing Indexes' section or other analyses dealing with `pg_stat_user_tables` if they are inefficient.

Hot Queries
|===
|query|calls|total_exec_time|mean_exec_time|rows|shared_blks_hit|shared_blks_read
|SHOW server_version_num|116|0.8898650000000002|0.00767125|0|0|0
|INSERT INTO healthy_company_data_co.module_findings (run_id, module_name, status, severity_level, severity_score, data_json, error_message) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7)|112|31.458775999999986|0.2808819285714285|112|1468|2
|SELECT count(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relkind = $1 AND relnamespace NOT IN (SELECT oid FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname LIKE $2 OR nspname = $3)|65|21.986852000000003|0.33825926153846153|65|975|0
|SHOW server_version|48|0.32102600000000003|0.006688041666666667|0|0|0
|SELECT relname, n_live_tup AS live_tuples, n_dead_tup AS dead_tuples FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE n_dead_tup > $1 ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC LIMIT $2|26|9.803238999999998|0.3770476538461538|0|364|0
|===
[TIP]
====
Focus on queries with a high `calls` count. Even if their `mean_exec_time_ms` is low, their cumulative impact can be significant. Investigate these queries for potential micro-optimizations, such as reducing redundant executions, optimizing caching at the application level, or ensuring they are fully covered by appropriate indexes. High `shared_blks_read` for hot queries indicates frequent disk I/O, which can be a bottleneck. For Aurora, highly frequent queries directly contribute to `CPUUtilization` and `IOPS`.
====


== Connections and Security

=== User Analysis
Analyzes database user roles and permissions to ensure secure access control.

User Roles
|===
|rolname|rolcanlogin|rolsuper|rolcreatedb|rolcreaterole
|postgres|True|True|True|True
|insecure_user|True|False|False|False
|admin_user|True|False|True|True

|postgres|information_schema.sql_features|DELETE
|postgres|information_schema.sql_features|INSERT
|postgres|information_schema.sql_features|SELECT
|postgres|information_schema.sql_features|TRUNCATE
|===
[TIP]
====
Ensure users have minimal required permissions (principle of least privilege). Avoid granting superuser or create role privileges unless necessary. For Aurora, manage roles via the RDS console and monitor user activity via CloudWatch Logs.
====


=== SSL Connection Statistics
Analyzes SSL connection usage to ensure secure communication with the database.

SSL Connections by User and Client Address
|===
|usename|client_addr|ssl|count
|postgres|192.168.1.219|True|1
|===
Overall SSL Usage Summary

|===
[TIP]
====
Ensure that `ssl` is 'true' for all critical connections to protect data in transit. If you see 'false' for `ssl` on connections that should be encrypted, investigate client configurations. For Aurora, SSL is typically enforced at the instance level and managed via parameter groups and security groups.
====


=== Security Audit
Analyzes key security configurations and user privileges to identify potential vulnerabilities.

|===
[TIP]
====
Review superuser roles and limit them to essential administrative accounts. Ensure all login roles have strong passwords and consider setting password expiration. Revoke unnecessary CREATE/USAGE privileges on the public schema to prevent unauthorized object creation. Enable connection and statement logging for auditing purposes. Ensure SSL is enabled for secure connections. For Aurora, manage roles and security settings via the RDS console and monitor CloudWatch Logs for security events.

|===
[TIP]
====
Monitor the total number of connections relative to `max_connections` to prevent connection exhaustion. High numbers of 'idle in transaction' or 'waiting' states may indicate application issues or lock contention. Optimize queries or adjust connection pooling settings to reduce idle connections. For Aurora, `max_connections` is managed via the parameter group, and connection monitoring can be done via CloudWatch.
====


Analyzes connection pooling statistics to optimize connection management.

PgBouncer Pool Statistics
[NOTE]
====
No data returned from PgBouncer.

====
No data returned from PgBouncer.
====

[TIP]
====
Connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) is crucial for managing database connections efficiently, reducing overhead from frequent connection/disconnection, and limiting the number of active backend connections. Monitor `active_connections`, `waiting_connections`, and `total_requests` to ensure your pooler is effectively handling load. Tune pooler settings (`pool_size`, `reserve_pool_size`, `server_lifetime`) for optimal performance.

=== Recommendations
=== General Recommendations Overview

This section provides a summary of key recommendations based on the overall health check findings. These are general best practices that apply to most PostgreSQL environments. For detailed, AI-generated, and context-specific recommendations, please refer to the "AI-Generated Recommendations" section.

.  **Regular Monitoring**: Establish continuous monitoring for key database metrics (CPU, I/O, connections, replication lag, cache hit ratio) and set up alerts for critical thresholds.
.  **Performance Tuning**: Regularly review `pg_stat_statements` to identify and optimize slow or frequently executed queries. Ensure proper indexing and consider query rewriting.
.  **Autovacuum Optimization**: Verify that autovacuum is running efficiently to prevent table bloat and transaction ID wraparound. Tune autovacuum parameters as needed.
.  **Security Hardening**: Implement strong password policies, use the principle of least privilege for users and roles, restrict network access, and enforce SSL for all connections.
.  **High Availability & Disaster Recovery**: Ensure your replication setup is healthy and monitor lag. Regularly test your backup and recovery procedures.
.  **Resource Management**: Optimize memory settings (`shared_buffers`, `work_mem`, `maintenance_work_mem`) based on your workload and available system resources.
.  **Regular Maintenance**: Perform routine database maintenance tasks, including `VACUUM ANALYZE`, index reindexing (if necessary), and cleanup of temporary objects.

[TIP]
====
A healthy PostgreSQL database requires continuous attention to monitoring, performance tuning, security, and maintenance. Prioritize recommendations that address the most significant risks or performance bottlenecks in your specific environment.
====



=== Pgbadger_Setup
=== pgBadger Setup and Analysis Recommendations

pgBadger is a powerful open-source PostgreSQL log analyzer that generates comprehensive HTML reports. It's invaluable for identifying slow queries, frequently executed queries, errors, and other log-based insights that complement `pg_stat_statements`.

.  **Enable Appropriate Logging**: For pgBadger to be effective, PostgreSQL needs to log sufficient information. Key `postgresql.conf` parameters to review/set:
    * `log_destination = 'csvlog'` (or `stderr` if you have a log collector)
    * `logging_collector = on` (if using `csvlog` or `stderr` to files)
    * `log_directory = 'pg_log'` (or your preferred log directory)
    * `log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'`
    * `log_min_duration_statement = 100ms` (or a value that captures your slow queries; set to `0` to log all statements, but be cautious of log volume)
    * `log_connections = on`
    * `log_disconnections = on`
    * `log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h '` (essential for pgBadger to parse context)
    * `log_lock_waits = on`
    * `log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0` (to log all autovacuum activity)
.  **Restart PostgreSQL**: A restart is required for changes to `log_destination`, `logging_collector`, `log_directory`, `log_filename`. A reload is sufficient for others.
.  **Collect Logs**: Ensure your log files are being collected and rotated appropriately.
.  **Run pgBadger**:
    * **Installation**: Install pgBadger (e.g., `sudo apt install pgbadger` on Debian/Ubuntu, or download from official site).
    * **Execution**: Run pgBadger against your PostgreSQL log files:
        ```bash
        pgbadger -f syslog -o /path/to/report/output.html /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-*.log
        # Or if using csvlog:
        pgbadger -f csv -o /path/to/report/output.html /var/lib/postgresql/15/main/log/*.csv
        ```
        Adjust paths and format (`-f`) as per your setup.
.  **Analyze Reports**: Review the generated HTML reports for:
    * Top slow queries
    * Queries by type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
    * Connections and disconnections
    * Error distribution
    * Checkpoints and temporary file usage

[TIP]
====
pgBadger is an indispensable tool for deep log analysis, providing insights not readily available from `pg_stat_statements` alone. Integrate it into your regular monitoring and troubleshooting routine.
====



== General PostgreSQL Best Practices

=== Index Management Best Practices
Indexes are crucial for optimizing query performance, especially for read-heavy workloads. However, poorly designed or unused indexes can degrade write performance and consume unnecessary storage.

.  **Use Indexes Judiciously**: Create indexes only on columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `DISTINCT` operations. Avoid over-indexing, especially on tables with high write activity.
.  **Monitor Index Usage**: Regularly review `pg_stat_user_indexes` to identify unused or rarely used indexes (`idx_scan = 0`). These indexes incur overhead without providing benefits and should be considered for removal.
.  **Avoid Duplicate Indexes**: Ensure you don't have redundant indexes that cover the same set of columns in the same order. Duplicate indexes waste disk space and increase write overhead.
.  **Consider Partial Indexes**: For large tables where queries often filter on a specific subset of data (e.g., `WHERE status = 'active'`), a partial index can be smaller and more efficient.
.  **Choose the Right Index Type**: Most indexes are B-tree, but consider other types like BRIN (for large, ordered data like timestamps), GIN (for full-text search or array columns), and GiST (for geometric or spatial data).
.  **Index Foreign Keys**: Always index foreign key columns on the child table. This prevents full table scans on the child table when rows are `DELETE`d or `UPDATE`d in the parent table, significantly reducing write amplification.
.  **Regularly Analyze Tables**: Ensure `autovacuum` is properly configured to run `ANALYZE` regularly. Up-to-date statistics are vital for the query planner to choose efficient index usage.
.  **`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`**: Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for creating new indexes on busy tables to avoid locking the table for writes.
.  **Reindex Bloated Indexes**: If an index becomes significantly bloated (e.g., after many updates/deletes), `REINDEX` can reclaim space and improve performance, but this is an exclusive lock operation unless done concurrently.

[TIP]
====
A well-indexed database is a performant database. Continuously review and optimize your indexing strategy as your application and data evolve.
====



=== Table Management Best Practices
=== Table Management Best Practices

Effective table management is fundamental to PostgreSQL performance, storage efficiency, and data integrity.

.  **Monitor Table Sizes**: Regularly track the size of your tables (including TOAST tables) to understand data growth patterns and identify unexpectedly large tables.
.  **Manage Bloat**: High `n_dead_tup` (dead tuples) indicates table bloat. Ensure autovacuum is effectively configured to reclaim space. Consider `VACUUM FULL` or `pg_repack` for severe bloat, but be aware of their locking behavior.
.  **Partition Large Tables**: For very large tables (e.g., multi-terabyte tables or tables with high insert/delete rates), consider implementing declarative partitioning. Partitioning can improve query performance by allowing "pruning" (scanning only relevant partitions) and simplify data archiving/purging.
.  **Review Table Design**: Ensure tables are normalized appropriately. Denormalization can sometimes be beneficial for read performance, but it increases write complexity and potential for data inconsistency.
.  **Choose Appropriate Data Types**: Use the most efficient data types for your columns (e.g., `INT` instead of `BIGINT` if values fit, `TEXT` only when necessary, `VARCHAR(N)` for fixed-length strings).
.  **Primary Keys**: Always define primary keys for your tables. They enforce uniqueness and provide a clustered index.
.  **Foreign Keys**: Use foreign keys to enforce referential integrity between tables. As discussed in the Foreign Key Audit, ensure they are properly indexed.
.  **TOAST Tables**: Be aware of TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique) tables for columns storing large values (e.g., `TEXT`, `BYTEA`). Monitor their size and bloat.
.  **Table Statistics**: Ensure `ANALYZE` runs regularly to keep table statistics up-to-date for the query planner. For tables with highly skewed data distribution or very high insert rates, consider setting `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS ...` for specific columns.

[TIP]
====
Proactive table maintenance and thoughtful design are key to long-term database health and performance.
====



=== User and Role Management Best Practices
=== User and Role Management Best Practices

Proper user and role management is a cornerstone of database security. Adhering to best practices minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users and roles only the minimum set of permissions necessary to perform their required tasks. Avoid granting excessive privileges (e.g., `SUPERUSER`, `CREATEDB`, `CREATEROLE`) unless absolutely essential for administrative accounts.
.  **Strong Passwords**: Enforce strong, complex passwords for all database users. Consider using a password manager.
.  **Password Expiration**: Implement password expiration policies and force regular password rotations.
.  **Separate Roles for Applications**: Create distinct roles for different applications or microservices. Do not use a single shared user for multiple applications.
.  **Audit User Activity**: Configure logging to capture connection attempts, disconnections, and potentially all executed statements to maintain an audit trail of user activity.
.  **Remove Unused Roles**: Regularly review `pg_roles` and remove any obsolete or unused user accounts.
.  **Role Inheritance**: Use role inheritance (`GRANT role_a TO role_b`) to simplify permission management, granting privileges to a base role and then granting that base role to specific users.
.  **Authentication Methods**: Prefer secure authentication methods like `SCRAM-SHA-256`, `cert`, or external authentication systems (e.g., LDAP, Kerberos) over weaker methods like `MD5` or `password`.
.  **Monitor Superusers**: Keep a very close eye on activities performed by superuser roles.

[TIP]
====
Security is an ongoing process. Regularly audit user privileges and authentication mechanisms to adapt to evolving threats.
====



=== General Security Best Practices
=== General Security Best Practices

Database security extends beyond user management to encompass network access, encryption, and logging.

.  **Network Access Control**: Restrict database access to only trusted IP addresses or networks using `pg_hba.conf` (for self-hosted) or Security Groups/Network ACLs (for cloud environments).
.  **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Always enforce SSL/TLS for all client connections to encrypt data in transit. This prevents eavesdropping and tampering. Ensure you are using strong ciphers and modern TLS versions (e.g., TLSv1.2 or higher).
.  **Regular Patching**: Keep your PostgreSQL server and underlying operating system (for self-hosted) up-to-date with the latest security patches and minor version releases.
.  **Audit Logging**: Configure comprehensive logging (`log_connections`, `log_disconnections`, `log_min_duration_statement`, `log_statement`) to capture security-relevant events. Centralize logs for easier analysis and alerting.
.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Apply this not only to users but also to database objects. Restrict `CREATE` privileges on the `public` schema to prevent unauthorized object creation by regular users.
.  **Backup and Recovery**: Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy. Encrypt backups at rest.
.  **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan your database and surrounding infrastructure for known vulnerabilities.
.  **Physical Security**: For self-hosted servers, ensure physical access to the database server is strictly controlled.

[TIP]
====
A layered security approach, combining network controls, strong authentication, encryption, and diligent auditing, provides the best defense.
====



=== Connection Management Best Practices
=== Connection Management Best Practices

Efficiently managing database connections is vital for performance and scalability, preventing connection storms and resource exhaustion.

.  **Monitor Connection Count**: Continuously track the total number of active connections against your `max_connections` limit. Approaching the limit can lead to application errors and connection rejections.
.  **Identify Idle Connections**: Look for `idle` and especially `idle in transaction` connections in `pg_stat_activity`. `idle in transaction` connections hold locks and consume resources, preventing vacuuming and potentially causing bloat.
.  **Implement Connection Pooling**: Use an external connection pooler (like PgBouncer or Amazon RDS Proxy) for applications with high connection churn or many concurrent processes. This reduces the overhead of establishing new connections and allows more efficient reuse of existing connections.
.  **Set Timeouts**: Configure `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, `idle_session_timeout`, `statement_timeout`, and `lock_timeout` to automatically terminate problematic or inactive sessions/queries. This prevents resource leaks and long-held locks.
.  **Optimize Application Connection Behavior**: Ensure your application properly closes connections, uses prepared statements effectively, and avoids long-running transactions.
.  **Review `max_connections`**: Adjust `max_connections` based on your server's resources and workload. Setting it too high can lead to excessive memory consumption and contention.
.  **Connection Throttling**: Consider implementing connection throttling at the application or load balancer layer to prevent sudden spikes from overwhelming the database.

[TIP]
====
Connection pooling is often the single most effective way to improve performance and stability for applications with high connection demands.
====



=== High Availability (HA) Best Practices
=== High Availability (HA) Best Practices

Implementing robust High Availability (HA) is crucial for ensuring continuous operation and minimizing downtime for your PostgreSQL database.

.  **Streaming Replication**: Utilize PostgreSQL's built-in streaming replication for physical standby servers. This provides a continuously updated copy of your primary database.
.  **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Replication**: Understand the trade-offs. Asynchronous is common for performance, while synchronous ensures zero data loss on primary failure but can impact write latency.
.  **Monitor Replication Lag**: Continuously monitor replication lag (e.g., `pg_stat_replication` or CloudWatch `ReplicaLag` for RDS/Aurora) to ensure your standby is up-to-date and ready for failover.
.  **Automated Failover**: For production environments, implement an automated failover solution (e.g., Patroni, repmgr for self-hosted; AWS Aurora's built-in failover, RDS Multi-AZ for managed services). Manual failover is slower and more prone to human error.
.  **Quorum and Split-Brain**: Ensure your HA solution correctly handles network partitions to prevent "split-brain" scenarios where both primary and standby believe they are the primary.
.  **WAL Archiving**: Maintain a robust WAL archiving strategy (e.g., to S3 for cloud, or a separate storage for self-hosted) to enable Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) and rebuild replicas.
.  **Regular Failover Testing**: Periodically test your failover procedures in a non-production environment. This validates your HA setup and familiarizes your team with the process.
.  **Network Configuration**: Ensure robust and low-latency network connectivity between primary and standby servers.
.  **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas (physical standbys) to offload read traffic from the primary, improving scalability and providing a warm standby.

[TIP]
====
HA is not just about having a standby; it's about having a tested, automated, and monitored process to ensure rapid recovery from failures.
====



== Platform-Specific Best Practices

=== AWS RDS/Aurora Best Practices
Optimizing PostgreSQL on AWS RDS and Aurora requires adherence to specific cloud-native best practices that leverage the managed service capabilities.

.  **Instance Sizing**: Choose the appropriate instance type (memory, CPU) and storage (IOPS, throughput) based on your workload's requirements. Don't over-provision, but ensure you have headroom for peak loads.
.  **Parameter Groups**: Understand and configure DB cluster parameter groups and DB parameter groups. These control most PostgreSQL settings. Apply changes carefully, noting which require a reboot.
.  **Monitoring**: Leverage Amazon CloudWatch for core metrics (CPUUtilization, DatabaseConnections, FreeableMemory, WriteIOPS, ReadIOPS, DiskQueueDepth, ReplicaLag). Enable Enhanced Monitoring for OS-level visibility. Use Amazon RDS Performance Insights for deep query analysis.
.  **High Availability**: For RDS, use Multi-AZ deployments. For Aurora, ensure you have sufficient Aurora Replicas distributed across Availability Zones for high availability and read scaling.
.  **Backups & PITR**: Configure automated backups with appropriate retention periods. Understand and test your Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) capabilities.
.  **Security**: Restrict network access using VPC Security Groups. Use IAM database authentication (for Aurora) or AWS Secrets Manager for credential management. Enforce SSL for all connections.
.  **Connection Management**: Consider Amazon RDS Proxy for efficient connection pooling, especially for serverless applications or those with high connection churn.
.  **Upgrades**: Plan and test major and minor version upgrades carefully. Utilize blue/green deployments or read replica promotions for minimal downtime.
.  **Storage Optimization**: For RDS, choose appropriate storage types (gp2, gp3, io1/io2). For Aurora, storage scales automatically, but monitor `VolumeBytesUsed` and `VolumeReadIOPS`/`VolumeWriteIOPS`.
.  **Logging**: Configure database logging via parameter groups to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. This centralizes logs for analysis and alerting (e.g., for slow queries, errors, deadlocks).
.  **Cost Optimization**: Regularly review resource utilization and scale down instances or storage if over-provisioned. Identify and drop unused indexes or tables.

[TIP]
====
AWS managed services abstract away much of the operational burden, but active monitoring and continuous optimization of database parameters and application queries are still essential for peak performance and cost efficiency.
====



=== Instaclustr Managed PostgreSQL Best Practices
Optimizing PostgreSQL on Instaclustr's Managed Platform involves leveraging their specific features and operational model.

.  **Instance Sizing**: Work closely with Instaclustr support to ensure your node size (CPU, RAM, storage) and cluster topology (number of nodes, replication factor) are appropriately sized for your workload.
.  **Monitoring**: Utilize Instaclustr's integrated monitoring dashboards (e.g., Grafana) for key PostgreSQL and underlying infrastructure metrics. Configure custom alerts for critical thresholds.
.  **High Availability**: Instaclustr provides highly available PostgreSQL clusters with automatic failover. Understand their failover mechanisms and RTO/RPO guarantees.
.  **Backups & PITR**: Leverage Instaclustr's automated backup and Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) capabilities. Ensure your backup retention policies meet your business continuity requirements.
.  **Security**: Adhere to Instaclustr's security recommendations, including network access controls (VPC peering, IP whitelisting), strong authentication, and SSL/TLS enforcement.
.  **Parameter Tuning**: Instaclustr manages most `postgresql.conf` parameters. Consult their documentation or support for guidance on tuning specific parameters for your workload.
.  **Upgrades**: Coordinate major and minor version upgrades with Instaclustr. They handle the upgrade process, but you should still test application compatibility in a staging environment.
.  **Logging**: Understand how Instaclustr provides access to PostgreSQL logs (e.g., via their console, integrated logging solutions). Configure `log_min_duration_statement` and other logging parameters as needed.
.  **Support Engagement**: Actively engage with Instaclustr's support team for complex issues, performance tuning advice, or capacity planning.

[TIP]
====
Leveraging Instaclustr's managed capabilities for infrastructure, patching, and backups frees you to focus on application-level optimization and query tuning.

=== NetApp ANF Storage Best Practices for PostgreSQL
NetApp Azure NetApp Files (ANF) and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP provide high-performance, low-latency file storage solutions that can significantly benefit PostgreSQL workloads, especially those with demanding I/O requirements.

.  **High Throughput & IOPS**: Leverage ANF's ability to deliver extremely high throughput and IOPS. Size your ANF volumes (capacity pools and service levels) to match or exceed your PostgreSQL workload's peak I/O demands.
.  **Low Latency**: ANF offers sub-millisecond latency, which is critical for transactional databases like PostgreSQL. Ensure your network configuration (e.g., Azure VNet integration, AWS VPC) is optimized to maintain this low latency.
.  **File System Choice**: While ANF presents as an NFS share, ensure the underlying PostgreSQL data directory is configured optimally for file system access (e.g., appropriate mount options).
.  **Snapshots & Clones**: Utilize ANF's integrated snapshot capabilities for rapid, space-efficient backups and recovery. Instantaneous volume clones can be invaluable for creating dev/test environments or for rapid database refreshes.
.  **Replication (Cross-Region/Cross-Cloud)**: Explore ANF's replication features for cross-region disaster recovery or hybrid cloud scenarios, ensuring your data is highly available and resilient.
.  **Cost Optimization**: Monitor ANF consumption and adjust service levels or capacity pools as needed to optimize costs without compromising performance.
.  **Monitoring**: Monitor ANF-specific metrics (throughput, IOPS, latency, capacity utilization) alongside your PostgreSQL database metrics to correlate performance.
.  **Patching & Maintenance**: Understand that ANF is a managed service, so NetApp handles the underlying storage maintenance. Focus on PostgreSQL-specific patching and maintenance.
.  **Security**: Apply network security best practices (e.g., network security groups, private endpoints) to restrict access to ANF volumes.

[TIP]
====
NetApp ANF can provide a significant performance boost for I/O-bound PostgreSQL workloads. Proper sizing and integration are key to maximizing its benefits.

[TIP]
====
Reviewing all PostgreSQL settings provides a complete picture of your database's configuration. Pay attention to settings related to memory, connections, logging, autovacuum, and WAL. Ensure settings are optimized for your workload and hardware, and align with best practices. For managed services like RDS/Aurora, most settings are managed via parameter groups.

|plpgsql|1.0|postgres|pg_catalog|False|None
|===
[TIP]
====
Review installed extensions to understand additional functionalities available in your database. Ensure all necessary extensions are installed and unnecessary ones are removed to minimize attack surface. Be aware of extensions that might consume significant resources or introduce compatibility issues during upgrades.
====


=== RDS/Aurora Upgrade Considerations
Provides recommendations and checks related to AWS RDS/Aurora PostgreSQL upgrades.
[TIP]
====
Regularly review new major and minor versions of PostgreSQL and Aurora for new features, performance improvements, and security patches. Plan upgrades carefully, testing application compatibility in a staging environment. Consider blue/green deployments or logical replication for minimal downtime upgrades. Always back up your database before a major upgrade.
====

[NOTE]
====
This section primarily focuses on AWS RDS/Aurora upgrade considerations. For self-hosted PostgreSQL, upgrade processes involve different steps, such as `pg_upgrade` for major versions or in-place updates for minor versions. Always consult PostgreSQL documentation for specific version upgrade paths.
====


=== AWS Region and Cloud Metrics
Provides notes on AWS region-specific considerations and fetches key cloud metrics for RDS/Aurora.
[NOTE]
====
For AWS RDS Aurora, region choice impacts latency, cost, and service availability. Ensure your application is deployed in the same region or a nearby region to minimize latency. Consider Aurora Global Database for cross-region disaster recovery. Always verify the availability of specific instance types and Aurora features in your chosen region.
