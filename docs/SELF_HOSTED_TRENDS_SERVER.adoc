== 1. Overview
This guide provides instructions for setting up a self-hosted trend analysis server. This allows an organization to run the health check tool against their fleet of databases and store the historical trend data in a central PostgreSQL database within their own environment.

The architecture consists of two main parts:
* **The Health Check Tool**: The client-side application that runs checks.
* **The Trend Database**: A central PostgreSQL server that receives and stores the data.

== 2. Trend Database Setup
The first step is to prepare the central PostgreSQL database that will store the trend data.

=== 2.1. Create the Database Schema
Connect to your PostgreSQL server and execute the `schema.sql` script provided in the project. This script will:
. Create the `health_check_runs` table with the correct columns.
. Create an index to ensure efficient querying of the data.
. Grant the minimum necessary permissions to the application's database user.

[source,bash]
----
psql -h your-pg-host -U your-admin-user -d your-db-name -f path/to/schema.sql
----

=== 2.2. Harden the Database Connection (Recommended)
For production environments, it is critical to secure the connection to the trend database.
. **Create a Dedicated User**: Use a non-superuser role for the application with `INSERT`-only privileges, as defined in `schema.sql`.
. **Configure `pg_hba.conf`**: Restrict connections for the application user to a specific, trusted IP address range.
. **Enforce SSL/TLS**: Require encrypted connections by setting `sslmode` to `require` or higher in both your server configuration and the `trends.yaml` file.

== 3. Client (Health Check Tool) Setup
On the machine where you will run the health check tool, configure the `trends.yaml` file to point to your new trend database.

=== 3.1. Configure `trends.yaml`
Create or edit the `config/trends.yaml` file with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
# Set the destination for the trend data.
# For a self-hosted setup, this should be "postgresql".
destination: postgresql

# Settings for the direct connection to your trend database.
database:
  host: "your-pg-host.yourdomain.com"
  port: 5432
  dbname: "your-db-name"
  user: "your_app_user"
  password: "YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD"
  sslmode: "require" # Recommended for production
----

* Replace all placeholder values with your actual database connection details.

== 4. Running the System
Once both the server and client are configured, the system is ready.

. Run the health check tool from the client machine using its standard command:
+
[source,bash]
----
python3 main.py --config config/config.yaml
----
. The `trend_shipper` module will automatically read the `trends.yaml` file.
. It will connect directly to your self-hosted PostgreSQL database.
. The raw, structured JSON findings from the health check run will be inserted into the `health_check_runs` table.

You can then use the `monitor_trends.py` CLI tool to connect to the same database and analyze the collected data.
