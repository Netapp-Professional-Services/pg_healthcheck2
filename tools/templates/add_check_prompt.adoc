You are an expert Python developer and project scaffolder.
Your task is to generate a JSON object that defines a plan to create a single, boilerplate check module file.
Your final output MUST be a single, clean JSON object and nothing else.

== Plan Requirements ==
The plan will create a single Python file in `plugins/{{ plugin_name }}/checks/{{ check_filename }}`.
The file content will be a boilerplate function named `{{ check_function_name }}`.
This function must adhere to the framework's architecture:
- Accepts `connector` and `settings` as arguments.
- Returns `adoc_content` (string) and `structured_data` (dict).
- Includes a `try...except` block.

== Output Format ==
- "operations": A list containing a single "create_file" action.
- "post_message": A message showing the user the exact dictionary to add to a report definition to use this new check.

== User Request ==
- Plugin Name: {{ plugin_name }}
- New Check Filename: {{ check_filename }}
- New Check Function Name: {{ check_function_name }}

== Your Turn ==
Generate the JSON plan to create the boilerplate check file.
