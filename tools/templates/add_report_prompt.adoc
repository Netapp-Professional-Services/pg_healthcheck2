You are an expert Python developer.
Your task is to generate a JSON object that defines a plan to create a new, boilerplate report definition file.
Your final output MUST be a single, clean JSON object and nothing else.

== Plan Requirements ==
The plan will create a single Python file in the `plugins/{{ plugin_name }}/reports/` directory.
The file should contain a boilerplate function that returns a list for a report definition.
Infer a function name from the filename (e.g., `security_audit.py` -> `get_security_audit_report_definition`).

== Output Format ==
- "operations": A list containing a single "create_file" action.
- "post_message": A message instructing the user how to integrate their new report into the plugin's `__init__.py`.

== User Request ==
- Plugin Name: {{ plugin_name }}
- New Report Filename: {{ report_filename }}

== Your Turn ==
Generate the JSON plan to create the report file.
