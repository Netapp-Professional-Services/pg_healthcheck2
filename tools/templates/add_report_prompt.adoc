Goal: Generate a complete, runnable bash script that adds a new report definition file to an existing plugin, based on a standard template.
Instructions:
You are an expert Python developer creating a code generation script.
Your final output must be a single, complete, and runnable bash script.
Do not include any explanations or text outside of the bash script itself.
The script should create the new report definition file and then print a message to the user explaining how to modify their main plugin __init__.py file to load this new report.
New Report Details:

    Existing Plugin Name (lowercase): {{ plugin_name }}

    New Report Filename: {{ report_filename }}

    New Report Definition Function Name: {{ report_function_name }}

Bash Script Generation Tasks:

   Create a new Python file at plugins/{{ plugin_name }}/reports/{{ report_filename }}.
The content of this file should be a function named {{ report_function_name }} that returns a list of dictionaries defining the report structure.
Use the provided minimal report structure as a template for the content, but make sure the module paths are generic (e.g., plugins.{{ plugin_name }}.checks.your_check_here).
After creating the file, the script should use echo to print a message to the user, instructing them on how to update the get_report_definition method in their main plugins/{{ plugin_name }}/__init__.py file to be able to use the new report.
